# Middleman / HTML5 Boilerplate Note

Please note that this port of Middleman 4.0 has been converted to use HAML and Sprockets, while using a Middleman 3.x workflow.

The original HTML5 Boilerplate documentation is included here for your reference, but certain things (e.g. ways of including, specific javascript and CSS paths) may be different in our implementation.
